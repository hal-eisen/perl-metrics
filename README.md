# perl-metrics

This program is intended to help perl programmers write better code
by becoming more aware of their coding style.  In particular, one
would like to know the code:comment ratio, the average number of
lines per subroutine, the longest subroutine, and things like that.

HJE in 2024: I wrote this back in 2001. I'm not even a Perl programmer any more. Just cleaning up the old hard drive.
